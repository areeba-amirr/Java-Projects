‚òï OOP Project in Java

Welcome to my Java project repository! This project is a demonstration of my understanding and application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using the Java language.

This repository will contain a series of classes that work together to create a functional application, showcasing key OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üí° Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated

Encapsulation: Data and methods are bundled within a class, and access to data is controlled via methods.

Inheritance: New classes are created from existing classes, inheriting their properties and methods. This allows for code reuse and a hierarchical structure.

Polymorphism: Objects of different classes are treated as objects of a common superclass. This is often achieved through method overriding and interfaces.

Abstraction: Complex implementation details are hidden, and only the essential features are shown to the user.
